            <p>Reminder to self: the cure for the writer's block is to flush 
                your brain out with a flood of input. Creativity is not some 
                ephemeral magic. Creativity is a place in your mind where you 
                don't feel ashamed and you have plenty of references. You 
                need to keep the well of inspiration topped up, and the best 
                things to put it into are things that look just like what you 
                want to get out of it.</p>

            <h3>
                My favorite movie:
            </h3>
            <img src="assets/imgs/memento.jpg" alt="poster for the movie Memento">
            <p>
                <span id="media-title">Memento</span> was a powerful influence on me creativly and 
                ideologically. The first half of the movie is in black and
                white, and the second half is in color. What makes this 
                movie so unique and inspiring is that the two halves are 
                interwoven, and the color scenes are played in reverse 
                chronological order. The big reveal, the last scene that 
                you see, is actually the middle of the film. Memento taught 
                me to look for assumptions that I didn't know I was making, 
                like for example, that stories go from beginning to middle, 
                to a climatic ending.

            <h3>
                My favorite album:
            </h3>
            <img src="assets/imgs/beatthechamp.jpg" alt="cover art for the album Beat the Champ by The Mountain Goats">
            <p>
                This is the fifteenth studio album from The Mountain Goats. 
                At first listen, the album seems to be a love letter to 
                professional wrestling. The conent of the lyrics certainly 
                seems to suggest so. Fairly quickly, the deeper themes of 
                death, hero worship, and ambition become too obvious to 
                ignore. This album is a constant reminder that everything 
                has a symbolic level that serves as a lense to better 
                understand the world through. It helps that I've had 
                deep love and appreciation for pro-wrestling since 
                I was five.

                My favorite book:
            </h3>
            <img src="assets/imgs/monsters.webp" alt="cover for the book Invisible Monsters by Chuck Palahniuk">
            <p>
                Written by Chuck Palahniuk (author of <span id="media-title">Fight Club</span>), 
                <span id="media-title">Invisible Monsters</span> is a brutal, nauseating, and 
                beautifully written story about a gorgeous supermodel 
                that gets disfigured in a car accident. This book is a 
                constant reminder that sometimes the things that hold 
                you back are going to be woven into the very foundations 
                of you. Eventually, you will have to mourn your past 
                self as you redfine the very fundamentals of what you 
                are. Caution: people at Palahniuk's live reading of 
                one of his other works (the aptly titled "Guts") have been 
                known to faint. Consider this a warning.
